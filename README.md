# ChembizZ_theChemicalProject
Project Overview:
The chemical project aims to establish a robust platform for managing various aspects of chemical procurement, customization, pricing, transaction facilitation, negotiation, documentation, testing, certification, delivery, lab verification, and user management.

Key Features:
Chemical Procurement:

Chemicals will be categorized based on their origin (animal or synthetic) and temperature requirements.
Separate processes will be defined for creating different types of chemicals.
Chemicals will be produced individually and then combined as needed for specific formulations.
Customization and Pricing:

The platform will offer customization options to tailor chemicals according to specific requirements.
Business pricing for chemicals will be subject to frequent changes to adapt to market dynamics.
Portfolio management tools will assist in selecting the right chemicals for various needs.
Identification and Listing:

Each chemical will be assigned unique IDs and cache numbers for precise identification.
Business persons will be linked to chemicals through these unique IDs and API numbers for streamlined management.
Quantity and Pricing Control:

Users will have the ability to specify the quantity and price for each chemical.
Minimum quantity and price thresholds will be defined, particularly in kilograms/grams, to ensure client confirmation.
Business Transactions:

The platform will facilitate internal trading for all users, primarily focusing on business-to-business (B2B) transactions.
Accuracy testing mechanisms will be implemented to ensure the reliability of transactions and data.
Negotiation and Deal Closure:

Users will be able to negotiate bulk prices through inquiry and chat discussions.
Deals will be confirmed or rejected, initiating further communication and documentation processes.
Communication and Documentation:

Robust communication features will be available for all users to streamline interactions.
Documentation generation will be automated for deals, including bills and certificates, to ensure transparency and compliance.
Phase 2 - Testing and Certification:

Post-chemical production, lab testing will be conducted to ensure quality and safety standards.
Certification will be issued for chemicals meeting the required criteria, with new users requiring certification authority approval for testing.
Filtering and Reporting:

Users will be able to filter chemicals based on certifications and other parameters.
Detailed reports will be generated, providing insights into various aspects such as time, price, and compliance.
Delivery Process:

The platform will manage delivery requests systematically, with proper address maintenance for delivery partners.
Sample collection will include PIN verification to ensure secure delivery processes.
Lab Verification and Status:

Lab PIN verification will be essential to ensure secure handling and tracking of chemicals.
System-generated PINs will facilitate chemical tracking within labs, ensuring proper verification and status updates.
In-built Software for Lab Processes:

In-built software will record essential data such as color, smell, and process information to aid in lab processes.
Automatic PDF report generation will streamline access to critical information for stakeholders.
Admin and User Management:

Admin privileges will oversee chemical management, ensuring proper oversight and control.
User roles will be defined for sellers, buyers, and courier partners, facilitating efficient user management and access control.
Conclusion:
In essence, the chemical project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for managing all aspects of chemical procurement, customization, transaction facilitation, testing, and delivery, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and compliance throughout the entire process.
